# Among-Us-VR---Confusing-Names-Mod
This mod is just a simple mod I decided to make.
There is 3 buttons to change everyone's name to something either funny or just plain confusing.
Everyone will be red also so you are forced to go by names.

NOTE: When this mod is active, access to Public Servers will be removed.
Take out the DLL file from Mods in MelonLoader to get access again.
